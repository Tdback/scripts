# Scripts #
This repo contains a collection of scripts that I use often. Some are quite
useful, while others are just for fun :)

## Getting Started ##
Simply clone this repo and add it to your `PATH`

## Requirements ##
Some scripts may require the following programs to be installed on your system
in order to run:
- curl
- fzf
- feh
- mpc
- scapy (Python library)
- POSIX compliant shell
- EDITOR (set this environment variable)
- BROWSER (set this environment variable)
